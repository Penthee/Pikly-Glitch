  text: It happened as fast as you could think. The generators surged and overloaded
    the entire facility, hundreds were lost in seconds. Then came... them. I'm blocking
    off the janitor storage in hope to hide from them. There should be enough food
    to last until help arrives, I know he steals canned meat from the cafe.
