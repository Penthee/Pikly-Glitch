  text: "Tarley, Chris : Marketing Executive 7-F\r\nSo I've had this brilliant new
    idea for a coffee machine. \r\nBear with me, a live service subscription coffee
    machine that will continuously scan your personal coffee needs, receive updates
    from around the facility.\r\nHere's the catch, here's how we force it to work.
    Give it away for free!\r\nIt doesn't matter how scummy we are as long as we sell
    the pure, unadulterated confidence that they are to receive the best damn coffee
    man can engineer on Phobos II.\r\nOf course, it would vapourise the remaining
    coffee if the user has not paid their weekly subscription."
