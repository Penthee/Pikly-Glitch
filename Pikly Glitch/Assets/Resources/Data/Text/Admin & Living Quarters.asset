    start to appear while doing some maintenance work in Administration.\r\nThrough
    the black came abominations. They are hungry.\r\nThe room I'm in seems to be safe.
    They cannot find me here but I'm running out of food.\r\nI need to get to the
    Main Teleporter, the one I came through when I arrived here. I need to get back
    to Earth."
